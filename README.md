Hello, my name is **Cody**!

I’m interested in software and game development and currently learning **ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, Django,** and other front-end languages. I've worked with **Python, Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript** in the past. I have also picked up **T-SQL, PostgreSQL, and Azure** systems from my past and current positions.

Message me if you have any inquiries or would like to get to know me better!
